This project analyzes user interactions with a course page to evaluate the impact of a new UI change. Key steps include calculating goal metrics for control and test groups to measure performance differences. The analysis applies **bootstrap methods** to compute confidence intervals, ensuring statistical reliability. Graphs are used to visualize the results for clearer interpretation. Finally, recommendations are provided based on the findings, with an optional **logistic regression model** applied to further assess whether the UI change should be implemented. This process emphasizes **statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling** for informed decision-making.
